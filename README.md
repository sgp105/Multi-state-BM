Before running the .ipynb file,
create a virtual Conda environment by running:

conda create -n <your_env_name> python=3.10

In the main source codes (model_selection~.ipynb & trajectory_segmentation~.ipynb), adjust the user_params to match your experimental settings.

************* model_selection must precede trajectory_segmentation. *************
